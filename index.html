        <strong>Taft Robotics Team:</strong> After the robotics team's administration graduated following the 2019-2020 school year, I was tasked with helping with outreach and teaching. To better appeal to both current members and
        those looking for more information, I designed and created the website. It contains content on both the organization and educational materials produced by me.

    <p class="style1">
        <strong>Taft Robotics Team:</strong> As the most experienced and advanced coder in the club and the onset of quarentine due to the COVID-19 pandemic, I decided to conduct live coding
        lessons which were then recorded for future reference by both members of the club and other visitors of the site/channel.

        <strong>Taft Model United Nations:</strong> Although I didn't have an official administrative position initially, after joining my school's Model United Nations club, there was blatant
        disorganization and a lack of out-reach. I proposed, planned, designed, and created a website to showcase the club and organize all relavant documents.
